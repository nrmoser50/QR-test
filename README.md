## My process

I started with what I knew off the top of my head. When I hit a roadblock I turned to artifical intelligence to help with structure and simplify the process. I cross checked with a few other solutions to compare and contrast my own work until I was satisfied with the outcome.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Coding is not an easy task. My personal challenge is sticking with it and work through my own doubts and continue practicing and improving my abilities.

### Continued development

Just keep on keeping on.
